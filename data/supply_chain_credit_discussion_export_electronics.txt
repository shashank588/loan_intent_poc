Speaker 1
00:00-00:00

Speaker 1 [00:00-00:00]: Hello.

Speaker 2
00:00-00:01

Speaker 2 [00:00-00:01]: Yes, Paras.

Speaker 1
00:02-00:03

Speaker 1 [00:02-00:03]: Yes, yes, tell me.

Speaker 2
00:03-00:04

Speaker 2 [00:03-00:04]: Did you call him just now?

Speaker 1
00:04-00:04

Speaker 1 [00:04-00:04]: Yes, that's right.

Speaker 2
00:04-00:06

Speaker 2 [00:04-00:06]: Yes, take it on call. Okay, wait.

Speaker 1
00:24-00:48

Speaker 1 [00:24-00:48]: The person you are talking to has put your call on hold. Please stay on the line. Please stay.

Speaker 2
00:48-00:49

Speaker 2 [00:48-00:49]: Yes.

Speaker 1
00:50-00:53

Speaker 1 [00:50-00:53]: Okay, this is on the Ankur Ji line.

Speaker 2
00:53-00:54

Speaker 2 [00:53-00:54]: Hello, Ankur Ji.

Speaker 1
00:54-00:56

Speaker 1 [00:54-00:56]: Hello, hello,

Speaker 2
00:55-01:02

Speaker 2 [00:55-01:02]: The day before yesterday, nothing connected with you, so should I talk to you a bit?

Speaker 1
01:01-01:04

Speaker 1 [01:01-01:04]: Yes, do it, do it, do it.

Speaker 2
01:03-01:05

Speaker 2 [01:03-01:05]: Okay sir, what is your turnover?

Speaker 1
01:06-01:13

Speaker 1 [01:06-01:13]: John and ours are around 10, 10:30, 10:30, 11:30 last year, 11.5 crores.

Speaker 2
01:13-01:14

Speaker 2 [01:13-01:14]: And in what do you do business?

Speaker 1
01:15-01:16

Speaker 1 [01:15-01:16]: In spices.

Speaker 2
01:16-01:19

Speaker 2 [01:16-01:19]: In spices, there is export of spices and domestic, how is it, I mean?

Speaker 1
01:20-01:27

Speaker 1 [01:20-01:27]: Even in domestic, we give to the exporter, and the rest is export. In short, it's not the local matter that we sell or take.

Speaker 2
01:27-01:33

Speaker 2 [01:27-01:33]: Okay, okay, now understand, if I have to do factoring in domestic, understand that you have to give in the supply chain in domestic.

Speaker 1
01:28-01:28

Speaker 1 [01:28-01:28]: Here.

Speaker 2
01:34-01:35

Speaker 2 [01:34-01:35]: So, who do you purchase from?

Speaker 1
01:36-01:42

Speaker 1 [01:36-01:42]: Our main business is farmers. The farmer's group, which includes POs and processors, all work together. By the way, I have my own factory.

Speaker 2
01:43-01:43

Speaker 2 [01:43-01:43]: Okay.

Speaker 1
01:43-01:51

Speaker 1 [01:43-01:51]: But sometimes, when we take orders beyond our capacity, we have to get them from someone else. So, we either take the processor.

Speaker 2
01:49-01:51

Speaker 2 [01:49-01:51]: We either take the processor or our

Speaker 1
01:51-01:56

Speaker 1 [01:51-01:56]: In our factory, we might directly pick the goods from the farmer or from the FPO or from the market.

Speaker 2
01:57-01:58

Speaker 2 [01:57-01:58]: Okay.

Speaker 1
01:58-02:02

Speaker 1 [01:58-02:02]: It comes completely through, completely with EGST, GST, GST whatever it is.

Speaker 2
01:58-01:58

Speaker 2 [01:58-01:58]: Okay.

Speaker 1
02:02-02:05

Speaker 1 [02:02-02:05]: It comes with it, there is nothing like that in it.

Speaker 2
02:02-02:06

Speaker 2 [02:02-02:06]: It comes with it, there is nothing like that in it. It comes with JC, right?

Speaker 1
02:06-02:11

Speaker 1 [02:06-02:11]: Yes, and that needs to be exported. It's not like I purchased and kept it.

Speaker 2
02:09-02:15

Speaker 2 [02:09-02:15]: It's not like I purchased and kept it. Yes, no, no, not that, no, no, do you know how it works?

Speaker 1
02:12-02:14

Speaker 1 [02:12-02:14]: What's in it? No, no, it's not there.

Speaker 2
02:16-02:35

Speaker 2 [02:16-02:35]: Regarding purchases, if GST etc. is agreed upon, then the agri-people will face some issues. That's why I'm asking. Generally, what happens is that lenders do not agree to purchases. If you are directly purchasing from farmers, then it won't happen. If you are doing GST, then it's fine.

Speaker 1
02:30-02:38

Speaker 1 [02:30-02:38]: It won't happen, I mean if you are doing GST in GST, then it's fine, I mean the GST GST processor will work, right?

Speaker 2
02:37-02:41

Speaker 2 [02:37-02:41]: Yes, it works, it works. Okay, what is the turnout? It's 10 crores, right?

Speaker 1
02:39-02:43

Speaker 1 [02:39-02:43]: How much is the turnover? Is it 10 crores? Yes, 11.5, 11.5.

Speaker 2
02:42-02:47

Speaker 2 [02:42-02:47]: Eleven, eleven-thirty, eleven-thirty, and what loans are currently available? Do you have any idea? Just give a rough estimate.

Speaker 1
02:47-02:54

Speaker 1 [02:47-02:54]: In the loan, you understand, my 2.8 is OD, not loan. What do you call it? OD for facility.

Speaker 2
02:53-02:55

Speaker 2 [02:53-02:55]: What do you call it? Odra facility.

Speaker 1
02:54-02:57

Speaker 1 [02:54-02:57]: Okay, it stays in our pocket, right?

Speaker 2
02:56-02:57

Speaker 2 [02:56-02:57]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 1
02:57-03:03

Speaker 1 [02:57-03:03]: And 1.87 CR of our Agri's centralized work.

Speaker 2
03:03-03:04

Speaker 2 [03:03-03:04]: Yes, this is it.

Speaker 1
03:03-03:07

Speaker 1 [03:03-03:07]: Yes, yes, we had a loan for infrastructure, machinery, etc.

Speaker 2
03:07-03:08

Speaker 2 [03:07-03:08]: Okay, is this secure or insecure?

Speaker 1
03:07-03:10

Speaker 1 [03:07-03:10]: With a lot of insecurity.

Speaker 2
03:11-03:13

Speaker 2 [03:11-03:13]: This 187 one is unsecured and the two-carriage one.

Speaker 1
03:13-03:15

Speaker 1 [03:13-03:15]: Yes, he teaches.

Speaker 2
03:15-03:22

Speaker 2 [03:15-03:22]: So, roughly, your four crore line is currently running.

Speaker 1
03:17-03:24

Speaker 1 [03:17-03:24]: Approximately, your four crore line is currently running. Yes, currently it is running this much, nothing else.

Speaker 2
03:25-03:31

Speaker 2 [03:25-03:31]: Okay, it will work. I will send the documentation list to Paras. Get it from them once.

Speaker 1
03:26-03:26

Speaker 1 [03:26-03:26]: Hmm.

Speaker 2
03:31-03:31

Speaker 2 [03:31-03:31]: Hmm.

Speaker 1
03:32-03:37

Speaker 1 [03:32-03:37]: Yes, yes, but also tell me how the service is, like what percentage it takes.

Speaker 2
03:32-03:35

Speaker 2 [03:32-03:35]: Yes, yes, but also tell me that

Speaker 1
03:38-03:41

Speaker 1 [03:38-03:41]: How much payment is received, how it is received, I need to know all that.

Speaker 2
03:40-03:49

Speaker 2 [03:40-03:49]: For example, do you understand how it is now? If you purchase goods from a purchaser, the payment goes directly to him, not to you.

Speaker 1
03:49-03:50

Speaker 1 [03:49-03:50]: Understood, ma'am.

Speaker 2
03:50-03:51

Speaker 2 [03:50-03:51]: Yes.

Speaker 1
03:50-03:54

Speaker 1 [03:50-03:54]: Like I have a purchase of two crores worth of chili, I have an order right now.

Speaker 2
03:55-03:55

Speaker 2 [03:55-03:55]: Yes.

Speaker 1
03:55-03:56

Speaker 1 [03:55-03:56]: Will you do it? Then directly to the party.

Speaker 2
03:55-03:58

Speaker 2 [03:55-03:58]: So the payment will go directly to your vendor in full.

Speaker 1
03:59-04:02

Speaker 1 [03:59-04:02]: Okay, then he went to Bhavendra and on top of that

Speaker 2
04:00-04:05

Speaker 2 [04:00-04:05]: Yes, and on top of that, you will get a maximum of 60 days, 90 days of credit.

Speaker 1
04:06-04:08

Speaker 1 [04:06-04:08]: sixty to ninety

Speaker 2
04:08-04:12

Speaker 2 [04:08-04:12]: In ninety days, you have a maximum of ninety days and a minimum of thirty days.

Speaker 1
04:12-04:13

Speaker 1 [04:12-04:13]: And I have to make that payment to you.

Speaker 2
04:14-04:16

Speaker 2 [04:14-04:16]: Yes, sir, after 90 days you will get the payment report.

Speaker 1
04:16-04:18

Speaker 1 [04:16-04:18]: It's a matter of time before it gets exported, right?

Speaker 2
04:17-04:38

Speaker 2 [04:17-04:38]: Yes. Yes, after 90 days, you will have to make the payment. After that, the limit opens again. Suppose, for example, your limit of 1 crore has been set. Okay? Today, you have paid 1 crore to 1 crore vendors. Used it. So, after 90 days, you have to return 1 crore, and after 91 days, your 1 crore will be restored.

Speaker 1
04:26-04:39

Speaker 1 [04:26-04:39]: Today, you have made payments to 1 crore vendors. You have used it. So, after 90 days, you have to return 1 crore, and after 91 days, your 1 crore will be back. You cannot exceed the limit.

Speaker 2
04:40-04:42

Speaker 2 [04:40-04:42]: The limit is only 1 crore.

Speaker 1
04:43-04:50

Speaker 1 [04:43-04:50]: No, like the limit is fixed, the limit is one crore, or how can you fix the limit of one crore?

Speaker 2
04:48-04:55

Speaker 2 [04:48-04:55]: Yes, we fix the limit by looking at your turnover, financial, GST, etc.

Speaker 1
04:55-04:59

Speaker 1 [04:55-04:59]: So how do they calculate it? For example, my estimate for this year is 20 crores.

Speaker 2
04:59-05:00

Speaker 2 [04:59-05:00]: Yes, okay.

Speaker 1
05:00-05:01

Speaker 1 [05:00-05:01]: One crore will be done in just two months.

Speaker 2
05:02-05:13

Speaker 2 [05:02-05:13]: No, it's okay. I am saying the same thing, six crores will be done in two months. But they look at the last two or three years' turnover, GST, banking, and on that basis, they give you a limit in that case.

Speaker 1
05:10-05:18

Speaker 1 [05:10-05:18]: In that case, they give you a limit. No, like my turn over is at 11:30, before that it was at 9:30, before that it was at 8.

Speaker 2
05:18-05:19

Speaker 2 [05:18-05:19]: Yes, so average.

Speaker 1
05:18-05:21

Speaker 1 [05:18-05:21]: If the average is 10, then it can be obtained.

Speaker 2
05:20-05:33

Speaker 2 [05:20-05:33]: Average ten means, look, basically, it should be around one crore. They give around 10-15% on the turnover. There should be a limit of one crore in it.

Speaker 1
05:30-05:39

Speaker 1 [05:30-05:39]: A limit of one crore should be reached, and for that, what happens is the bank account opens, or in that, I don't know how it happens.

Speaker 2
05:38-05:47

Speaker 2 [05:38-05:47]: No, no, look at this, do you know what it's like? You get a platform, meaning you get an app. Through the app, your vendors are registered there.

Speaker 1
05:44-05:44

Speaker 1 [05:44-05:44]: This is a transcription of the audio.

Speaker 2
05:47-05:50

Speaker 2 [05:47-05:50]: Through the hand, you initiate the payment to the vendor.

Speaker 1
05:47-05:48

Speaker 1 [05:47-05:48]: From hand to

Speaker 2
05:51-05:54

Speaker 2 [05:51-05:54]: Ah, whoever is behind, from whom your process will be.

Speaker 1
05:51-05:51

Speaker 1 [05:51-05:51]: Previous.

Speaker 2
05:55-06:11

Speaker 2 [05:55-06:11]: Like ABFL, Muthoot, Tata Capital, if someone has it, your payment will go to the vendor through the lender. You will get the UTR, and in 90 days, you will have to make the repayment in the same virtual account.

Speaker 1
05:55-06:09

Speaker 1 [05:55-06:09]: Like ABFL, Muthoot, and Tata Capital, if someone has an overdraft, your payment will go to the vendor through them. You will get their UTR, and then it will be 90 days.

Speaker 2
06:11-06:12

Speaker 2 [06:11-06:12]: Did you understand?

Speaker 1
06:13-06:15

Speaker 1 [06:13-06:15]: Okay, and what if it happens before that?

Speaker 2
06:16-06:21

Speaker 2 [06:16-06:21]: If it happens before that, you can do it before that. The interest rate will be less, and it is interest-based on a daily basis. For example, if you have five days...

Speaker 1
06:20-06:24

Speaker 1 [06:20-06:24]: If you have five days, what is the minimum number? No, no, it's not like that, you have five.

Speaker 2
06:23-06:27

Speaker 2 [06:23-06:27]: No, no, it's not like that. You used it for five days and repaid it after five days.

Speaker 1
06:26-06:28

Speaker 1 [06:26-06:28]: Okay, okay, it will take five days.

Speaker 2
06:27-06:30

Speaker 2 [06:27-06:30]: Okay, so it will take five days. Yes, it will take five days for you in that.

Speaker 1
06:30-06:34

Speaker 1 [06:30-06:34]: And do I have to do it for you or how do I have to do it?

Speaker 2
06:34-06:39

Speaker 2 [06:34-06:39]: No, the one who will be with the lender, like if you understand, it happened with Aditya Birla.

Speaker 1
06:38-06:40

Speaker 1 [06:38-06:40]: Muthoot happened, so we have to do Muthoot.

Speaker 2
06:39-06:42

Speaker 2 [06:39-06:42]: If it is from Muthoot, then you have to make the payment to Muthoot.

Speaker 1
06:41-06:44

Speaker 1 [06:41-06:44]: Hmm, you will give me more details. Yes, it will be written in the app.

Speaker 2
06:43-06:45

Speaker 2 [06:43-06:45]: Yes, yes, it will be visible in the app, it will be visible in the app, I will show you.

Speaker 1
06:45-06:47

Speaker 1 [06:45-06:47]: Understood, understood.

Speaker 2
06:47-06:47

Speaker 2 [06:47-06:47]: Yes.

Speaker 1
06:47-06:49

Speaker 1 [06:47-06:49]: And what is the interest rate generally?

Speaker 2
06:49-06:54

Speaker 2 [06:49-06:54]: Interest rates generally start from 15% to 18%, with a processing fee of 2%.

Speaker 1
06:55-06:56

Speaker 1 [06:55-06:56]: Oh, that's too much.

Speaker 2
06:56-06:56

Speaker 2 [06:56-06:56]: Yes, I have seen it.

Speaker 1
06:56-06:59

Speaker 1 [06:56-06:59]: So, you were saying ten or twelve, what is eleven, brother Paras bhai?

Speaker 2
06:56-06:57

Speaker 2 [06:56-06:57]: That's it.

Speaker 1
07:00-07:03

Speaker 1 [07:00-07:03]: It's in our export, sir. Okay, it's in export.

Speaker 2
07:03-07:03

Speaker 2 [07:03-07:03]: I am.

Speaker 1
07:04-07:05

Speaker 1 [07:04-07:05]: Yes, it is available.

Speaker 2
07:04-07:05

Speaker 2 [07:04-07:05]: Yes, it has to be done.

Speaker 1
07:05-07:06

Speaker 1 [07:05-07:06]: Yes.

Speaker 2
07:05-07:10

Speaker 2 [07:05-07:10]: Because this is an unsecured line, right? But Ankur Bhai, this is a completely unsecured line.

Speaker 1
07:06-07:14

Speaker 1 [07:06-07:14]: It's an unsecured line, right? Yes, I understand, Ankur Bhai. This is a completely unsecured line. Yes, I took working capital in the secure category, but it's not enough for me.

Speaker 2
07:13-07:17

Speaker 2 [07:13-07:17]: Hmm, that's why I said this is a completely unsecured line, there's nothing else for it.

Speaker 1
07:14-07:21

Speaker 1 [07:14-07:21]: This is a completely unsecured line, there's nothing else for it. Okay, okay, and it will be available based on the turnover.

Speaker 2
07:21-07:22

Speaker 2 [07:21-07:22]: Yes, you will get a train and a four-wheeler.

Speaker 1
07:23-07:25

Speaker 1 [07:23-07:25]: So you also give only 10-15 percent?

Speaker 2
07:25-07:33

Speaker 2 [07:25-07:33]: Look, your previous limit is also running, right? Like, if your average is 10 crores, then the limit is turning, so you already have it.

Speaker 1
07:32-07:38

Speaker 1 [07:32-07:38]: I have it. Look, if I show you a town worth 100 crores, for example, I am not doing it for this reason. No, look, what I am saying is...

Speaker 2
07:36-07:38

Speaker 2 [07:36-07:38]: No, look, what's in it, no.

Speaker 1
07:38-07:39

Speaker 1 [07:38-07:39]: I am speaking openly.

Speaker 2
07:39-07:40

Speaker 2 [07:39-07:40]: Yes.

Speaker 1
07:39-07:45

Speaker 1 [07:39-07:45]: Yes, we have a lot of orders from CID and my only intention in exports is to connect with Paras bhai.

Speaker 2
07:41-07:45

Speaker 2 [07:41-07:45]: In exports, joining Paras Bhai means only one thing.

Speaker 1
07:45-07:50

Speaker 1 [07:45-07:50]: In CAD, his team, my backup, these finance officers stood by me.

Speaker 2
07:50-07:50

Speaker 2 [07:50-07:50]: Hmm.

Speaker 1
07:50-07:55

Speaker 1 [07:50-07:55]: And he checks whether the person is genuine or not, the importer.

Speaker 2
07:54-07:59

Speaker 2 [07:54-07:59]: No, see how it is. If your transaction is good, people can extend it every six months.

Speaker 1
08:00-08:08

Speaker 1 [08:00-08:08]: Exactly, exactly, so I need a security check. No, no, if your wire is genuine or not. No, no, if your transaction is genuine.

Speaker 2
08:02-08:11

Speaker 2 [08:02-08:11]: No, no, if your transaction was good, your repayment and everything was good, then yes.

Speaker 1
08:10-08:13

Speaker 1 [08:10-08:13]: And look at the half-yearly record, there is no difference in that.

Speaker 2
08:12-08:16

Speaker 2 [08:12-08:16]: Yes, no, no, they can increase it every six months, there is no limit to that.

Speaker 1
08:16-08:22

Speaker 1 [08:16-08:22]: What I need is to read about the trading of those who have 50 paise each. I have many buyers.

Speaker 2
08:21-08:23

Speaker 2 [08:21-08:23]: He is very outside with me.

Speaker 1
08:23-08:26

Speaker 1 [08:23-08:26]: But I don't do local finance for finance.

Speaker 2
08:26-08:27

Speaker 2 [08:26-08:27]: Okay.

Speaker 1
08:27-08:31

Speaker 1 [08:27-08:31]: I have a lot of orders, but I don't do it because I need to make an immediate payment locally.

Speaker 2
08:31-08:37

Speaker 2 [08:31-08:37]: Look, I am telling you, Ankur Bhai, give me the documents, I will do as much as I can for you, okay?

Speaker 1
08:37-08:48
