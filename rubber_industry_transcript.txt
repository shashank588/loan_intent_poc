Speaker 1
00:53-00:57

Speaker 1 [00:53-00:57]: Yes, ma'am, where do you do procurement from? I mean, who are your home vendors?

Speaker 2
00:59-01:09

Speaker 2 [00:59-01:09]: Hello, we are vendors, basically local players, we outsource directly from the factory.

Speaker 1
01:09-01:09

Speaker 1 [01:09-01:09]: Um.

Speaker 2
01:09-01:16

Speaker 2 [01:09-01:16]: And they are like MSMEs, small ones, and then we go and provide to CATMRA, etc.

Speaker 1
01:16-01:19

Speaker 1 [01:16-01:19]: So, what are you looking for in finance? What do you need?

Speaker 2
01:20-01:36

Speaker 2 [01:20-01:36]: So basically, I just wanted to know what different products are there because I was going through your website and saw many different products. So can you tell me a little about what products are there so that I can get an understanding of how they are?

Speaker 1
01:29-01:42

Speaker 1 [01:29-01:42]: I saw many different products, so can you tell me a bit about what those products are? It will give me an understanding of how they are. Okay, ma'am, we have two products. One is at the purchase site. We call it a purchase sales invoice counting.

Speaker 2
01:41-01:41

Speaker 2 [01:41-01:41]: Okay, sir.

Speaker 1
01:43-01:47

Speaker 1 [01:43-01:47]: How do we interpret the bill for the material you purchase?

Speaker 2
01:45-01:46

Speaker 2 [01:45-01:46]: Hmm.

Speaker 1
01:47-01:50

Speaker 1 [01:47-01:50]: We give you a limit for purchases.

Speaker 2
01:47-01:47

Speaker 2 [01:47-01:47]: Hmm.

Speaker 1
01:50-01:53

Speaker 1 [01:50-01:53]: When you purchase stock in it, your bill comes.

Speaker 2
01:50-01:53

Speaker 2 [01:50-01:53]: When you purchase stock in it, your bill comes.

Speaker 1
01:54-02:01

Speaker 1 [01:54-02:01]: You put that bill on our website, I mean on the platform, and we upfront make the payment to your corporate, to any vendor you have.

Speaker 2
01:54-02:05

Speaker 2 [01:54-02:05]: On our website, I mean on the platform, we upfront make the payment to your corporate, whichever vendor it is. By vendor, I mean corporate, like Tata Motors is mine.

Speaker 1
02:05-02:07

Speaker 1 [02:05-02:07]: No, no, no, ma'am, like the way you purchase.

Speaker 2
02:06-02:09

Speaker 2 [02:06-02:09]: Like the ones you purchase. Okay, that's fine.

Speaker 1
02:09-02:21

Speaker 1 [02:09-02:21]: Yes, on the purchase side, it happens that your vendors, wherever you purchase from, we upfront make the payment, and you get credit on that bill for 60 days, 90 days, up to 90 days.

Speaker 2
02:22-02:24

Speaker 2 [02:22-02:24]: Is this fixed until now?

Speaker 1
02:24-02:26

Speaker 1 [02:24-02:26]: Yes, it is fixed for 90 days.

Speaker 2
02:26-02:28

Speaker 2 [02:26-02:28]: Okay, fine.

Speaker 1
02:27-02:33

Speaker 1 [02:27-02:33]: Yes, so this is the purchase side. What happens on the sales side, ma'am? Like now Tata Motors, CHC.

Speaker 2
02:31-02:31

Speaker 2 [02:31-02:31]: All work

Speaker 1
02:33-02:38

Speaker 1 [02:33-02:38]: If you sell to CH, these are your known and rated buyers.

Speaker 2
02:38-02:39

Speaker 2 [02:38-02:39]: Hmm.

Speaker 1
02:39-02:40

Speaker 1 [02:39-02:40]: So what do we do here?

Speaker 2
02:39-02:39

Speaker 2 [02:39-02:39]: So here we have to

Speaker 1
02:40-02:50

Speaker 1 [02:40-02:50]: You can get this done by providing a bill discount. What happens with a sales bill discount is like when you send procurement material to Tata.

Speaker 2
02:46-02:46

Speaker 2 [02:46-02:46]: Hmm.

Speaker 1
02:50-02:52

Speaker 1 [02:50-02:52]: Okay, your GRN has arrived.

Speaker 2
02:50-02:51

Speaker 2 [02:50-02:51]: Your GRN has arrived.

Speaker 1
02:52-02:58

Speaker 1 [02:52-02:58]: Okay, the year-end received bill has arrived after signing up. You upload it on the platform.

Speaker 2
02:52-02:56

Speaker 2 [02:52-02:56]: The year-end received will be marked with a time stamp.

Speaker 1
02:58-03:04

Speaker 1 [02:58-03:04]: You get 80% of the amount and 90% in your account.

Speaker 2
03:00-03:07

Speaker 2 [03:00-03:07]: 80% and 90% of it is credited to your account. Who gives this? The bank does.

Speaker 1
03:07-03:08

Speaker 1 [03:07-03:08]: There is a bank and a BPSC in this, ma'am.

Speaker 2
03:09-03:12

Speaker 2 [03:09-03:12]: It's a bank, it's NBFC, okay.

Speaker 1
03:12-03:32

Speaker 1 [03:12-03:32]: Hmm, and it means it comes into your current account or ODCC account. And in this, one thing can happen, ma'am, if the lender wants, they ask for an escrow account where your receivable comes in, meaning Tata Motors' payment comes in, and from there they withdraw their money, and the rest of the repayment money is transferred to your account. Here too, you get a 90-day tenure.

Speaker 2
03:16-03:35

Speaker 2 [03:16-03:35]: And in this, one thing can happen, ma'am, if the lender wants, they ask for an escrow account where your receivable comes in, meaning Tata Motors' payment comes in, and from there they withdraw their money, and the rest is transferred to your account. Here, you also get a 90-day tenure.

Speaker 1
03:35-03:35

Speaker 1 [03:35-03:35]: Yes.

Speaker 2
03:35-03:38

Speaker 2 [03:35-03:38]: And okay, okay, I understand.

Speaker 1
03:38-03:38

Speaker 1 [03:38-03:38]: Yes.

Speaker 2
03:38-03:39

Speaker 2 [03:38-03:39]: So, these are just two products.

Speaker 1
03:39-03:53

Speaker 1 [03:39-03:53]: Yes, these are two products. And if you need a business loan, ODCC, or working capital, we can arrange that too. But generally, since these products will suit you, I have pitched these products to you.

Speaker 2
03:48-03:59

Speaker 2 [03:48-03:59]: I mean, how will it be that this product suits you, so I pitched both products to you. Okay, what are you saying about this loan, tell me a little about the other products as well, give me an idea.

Speaker 1
03:58-04:04

Speaker 1 [03:58-04:04]: Look, you generally need an OD (Operating Director) from any bank or NBFC, and we also arrange that for you.

Speaker 2
04:02-04:02

Speaker 2 [04:02-04:02]: Um.

Speaker 1
04:04-04:06

Speaker 1 [04:04-04:06]: Working capital means CC and such things.

Speaker 2
04:06-04:08

Speaker 2 [04:06-04:08]: So I can go directly too.

Speaker 1
04:07-04:12

Speaker 1 [04:07-04:12]: Yes, that's what I'm saying, that's why I didn't pitch it to you, but the discounting structure is there.

Speaker 2
04:09-04:09

Speaker 2 [04:09-04:09]: That's why I told you.

Speaker 1
04:12-04:18

Speaker 1 [04:12-04:18]: It will suit you, that's why I told you specifically, and our expertise is in this.

Speaker 2
04:19-04:22

Speaker 2 [04:19-04:22]: Okay, and do you also provide loans and such?

Speaker 1
04:20-04:24

Speaker 1 [04:20-04:24]: Do you guys also give loans etc.? Yes yes, we also give loans etc.

Speaker 2
04:23-04:28

Speaker 2 [04:23-04:28]: Okay, so all the LOS, LMS, etc., are on your platform.

Speaker 1
04:28-04:30

Speaker 1 [04:28-04:30]: Yes, yes, that's our platform.

Speaker 2
04:30-04:46

Speaker 2 [04:30-04:46]: Okay, fine, so which buyers do you have? Should they be my buyers like Tata Motors, CAT, MRF, or do you connect others with them?

Speaker 1
04:47-04:51

Speaker 1 [04:47-04:51]: No, no, no, your own wires, we don't connect with others, your own wires.

Speaker 2
04:51-04:55

Speaker 2 [04:51-04:55]: So, like, uh, I inquired at a place yesterday, so on their platform

Speaker 1
04:56-04:56

Speaker 1 [04:56-04:56]: Hmm.

Speaker 2
04:56-05:03

Speaker 2 [04:56-05:03]: Tata Motors, CEAT, MRF etc. were not there because those people were not listed as buyers in it. So you all have it.

Speaker 1
05:02-05:04

Speaker 1 [05:02-05:04]: So, are you all there? Yes, yes, we are also there.

Speaker 2
05:05-05:08

Speaker 2 [05:05-05:08]: You mean all the segments?

Speaker 1
05:08-05:09

Speaker 1 [05:08-05:09]: Correct, correct.

Speaker 2
05:10-05:15

Speaker 2 [05:10-05:15]: Okay, okay, and in banks, there are good banks and NBFCs, etc. There are also PSUs, etc.

Speaker 1
05:16-05:23

Speaker 1 [05:16-05:23]: Yes, PSUs are there, but generally, banks and NBFCs are there. We mainly get it done through NBFCs.

Speaker 2
05:23-05:26

Speaker 2 [05:23-05:26]: Which banks will be included in NDS and which banks?

Speaker 1
05:26-05:28

Speaker 1 [05:26-05:28]: We have Kotak, we have RBL.

Speaker 2
05:29-05:36

Speaker 2 [05:29-05:36]: Okay, and who decides which bank to choose?

Speaker 1
05:36-05:59

Speaker 1 [05:36-05:59]: That depends upon the rate you get, ma'am. We ask you, 'Ma'am, this rate is in this bank or this rate is in this NBFC.' You tell us to do it in this or that. And majorly, if you need a higher limit. Then those body limits are found in big industries like ABFL or Tata Capital. Only these people can set body limits. Because your requirement will also be higher, like if your turnover is 17 crores.

Speaker 2
05:46-05:59

Speaker 2 [05:46-05:59]: Then those body limits are found in big industries like ABFL or Tata Capital. Only these people can set body limits. Because your requirement will also be high, like if your turnover is 17 crores.

Speaker 1
05:59-06:02

Speaker 1 [05:59-06:02]: So, at least you will need at least two to three crores in that case.

Speaker 2
05:59-06:06

Speaker 2 [05:59-06:06]: At least you will need at least two to three crores in that case. And which NBFCs are there on your platform?

Speaker 1
06:05-06:09

Speaker 1 [06:05-06:09]: There are ten to twelve NBFCs. There's ABFL, Tata, and Tiger.

Speaker 2
06:06-06:06

Speaker 2 [06:06-06:06]: Just speak.

Speaker 1
06:09-06:13

Speaker 1 [06:09-06:13]: It is credible, it is NDP, many.

Speaker 2
06:14-06:25

Speaker 2 [06:14-06:25]: Okay, and like, I mean, we are MSMEs, so what other segments do you look at? Apart from MSMEs, do you also look at large companies?

Speaker 1
06:25-06:39

Speaker 1 [06:25-06:39]: Yes, how are the big companies, ma'am? Like now, we have a program for Dabur and others, and we also have a dealer financing program for vendors. Like their dealers, distributors.

Speaker 2
06:35-06:40

Speaker 2 [06:35-06:40]: Like their dealers, their dealers, distributors, they need to fund them.

Speaker 1
06:40-06:54

Speaker 1 [06:40-06:54]: They need to provide funding. In that, the corporate company, the big company, provides us security. So, it means it has 100-200 distributors. Those 100-200 distributors need to provide funding. Their bill needs to be discounted. So, these are all the things involved in it.

Speaker 2
06:51-06:56

Speaker 2 [06:51-06:56]: So these are all the things in it. Okay, what is the pricing, brother?

Speaker 1
06:57-07:10

Speaker 1 [06:57-07:10]: Definitely, ma'am, it varies based on your profile. If your profile is good, then definitely NBFC starts at 12% to 15-16%. And if it's a bank, then the bank definitely starts at 8-9%.

Speaker 2
07:12-07:24

Speaker 2 [07:12-07:24]: Okay, fine, and this is fine, okay, fine, brother, I will talk to you once and let you know, I mean, I will discuss it with you, call on this number.

Speaker 1
07:24-07:25

Speaker 1 [07:24-07:25]: Yes, it will be fine, no problem.

Speaker 2
07:25-07:27

Speaker 2 [07:25-07:27]: Alright brother, thank you so much.

Speaker 1
07:27-07:27

Speaker 1 [07:27-07:27]: Thank you, thank you, bye.
