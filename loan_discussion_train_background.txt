05:07-05:10

Speaker 2 [05:07-05:10]: The bank also asks for security from the bank.

Speaker 2 [05:12-05:16]: Ha, eight eight taka seven taka seven lakhs

Speaker 1
05:15-05:18

Speaker 1 [05:15-05:18]: If the security goes up to five lakhs, then security is maximum.

Speaker 2
05:16-05:19

Speaker 2 [05:16-05:19]: If it goes up for the bank, then it will be a security matter.

Speaker 1
05:19-05:20

Speaker 1
05:23-05:34

Speaker 1 [05:23-05:34]: What security is needed? No, no, above five, local bank. Now, if our bank goes above five, then security is required.

Speaker 2
05:25-05:37

Speaker 2 [05:25-05:37]: No, no, above five, local bank. Now, if our bank goes above five, then security is required. Sir, we don't know, if it goes above five, then security is required. Then how do you know? When taking security, then the stock is hypothetically taken.

Speaker 1
05:37-05:39

Speaker 1 [05:37-05:39]: I would have taken it.

Speaker 2
05:39-05:40

Speaker 2 [05:39-05:40]: It is given on the stock.

Speaker 1
05:40-05:42

Speaker 2
05:42-05:46

Speaker 1 [06:12-06:13]: Are you okay?

Speaker 2
06:14-06:27

Speaker 2 [06:14-06:27]: If not in this city, then even if it's in an outside city, it's fine. But something has to be done on its own. For example, many people come to Pune, both are rented, and there's a house in the village on its own. Then, if the light bill is shown there, it's fine.

Speaker 2
06:29-06:35

Speaker 2 [06:29-06:35]: How much is the civil cost? The civil cost is around 680.
